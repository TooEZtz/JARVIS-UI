# Integration Placeholders Documentation

## Frontend

1. startSpeechRecognition
   - Listens to user's speech using the Web Speech API.
   - On speech end, converts speech to text and calls sendUserTextToBackend.

2. sendUserTextToBackend
   - Sends recognized text to backend endpoint /api/user-text as JSON.
   - Placeholder for future: can be extended to send to a more advanced backend for processing.

## Backend (Flask)

1. /api/user-text (POST)
   - Receives JSON: { \"text\": \"...\" }
   - Placeholder: Currently writes the text to user_texts.txt (append mode).
   - Future: Replace this logic to forward/process the text as needed by the main backend.

2. user_texts.txt
   - Stores all received user texts for debugging/demo purposes.

3. ask_gemini(user_sentence)
   - Sends a prompt to Gemini with the user's sentence.
   - Placeholder: You can customize the prompt as needed.

4. synthesize_speech(text)
   - Sends text to ElevenLabs TTS and returns audio.

5. /api/ask-gemini (POST)
   - Receives: { "text": "..." }
   - Returns: audio/mpeg (Gemini's response spoken by ElevenLabs)
   - Placeholder: Replace Gemini API call or TTS logic as needed.

## Integration Notes

- All endpoints are CORS-enabled for local development.
- Replace the placeholder logic in /api/user-text with your friend's backend integration when ready.
- This documentation should be updated as new placeholders or integration points are added.
